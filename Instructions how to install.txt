#open powershell not cmd  AND DO STEPS IN ORDER

1.create virtual environment

conda create -n chatbot python=3.10 --yes
conda activate chatbot


2.  Install System-Level Libraries:

conda install -c conda-forge cudnn portaudio --yes



3.Set the build flags for llama-cpp-python:

$env:CMAKE_ARGS = "-DGGML_CUDA=on"
$env:FORCE_CMAKE = "1"


4.Install All Other Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt



5.Install PyTorch (GPU Version) and make sure cuda is insatalled:

pip install torch==2.1.2+cu121 torchvision==0.16.2+cu121 torchaudio==2.1.2+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121



6. download one of the following models and put it in the same folder of the project and make SURE of the name
 (sometimes there will be a dot in the name remove it) make sure to edit the name in chatbot.py too.

    The models from huggingsface:


gemma-2b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf    #this is best, fast and good in following prompts so far

Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf    #this a little slow 

phi-2-Q4_K_M.gguf      #this one is fast but a little dumb.



6. you can replace my_voice.wav with other voice to change the voice of the character.
-It basically clone my_voice.wav and use it to generate sound with the same voice tone.
-Recommended .wav length is 30 - 60s. you can make the voice sample longer than 60s to 
increase quality but it will take longer to generate the voice.
